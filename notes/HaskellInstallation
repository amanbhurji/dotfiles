Installation with ghcup on a clean fedora instance

Missing Dependencies -
* make
* gmp-devel
* zlib-devel
* ncurses-devel

```
dnf install -y make gmp-devel zlib-devel ncurses-devel
```

Stack installation also installs these alongside few other dependencies

# haskell-ide-engine installation notes -

Installation with cabal -
Running `stack ./install.hs cabal-ghcs` does seem to download stack. Whether it proceeds to install cabal and rest of the tools using stack is untested so far.

Running `stack ./install.hs hie-8.6.3` installs stack and Cabal + other stuff to a total of ~10G! All of this duplication might be preventable if stack is not required and installation is done via stack.
More testing is required.
